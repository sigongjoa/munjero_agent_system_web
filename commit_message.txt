feat: Improve Puppeteer Docker environment and D-Bus handling

This commit addresses persistent issues with the Puppeteer Docker environment, specifically related to D-Bus and Xvfb setup, which caused `dbus-launch` failures and container timeouts.

Key changes include:
- Reverted Dockerfile.puppeteer to use node:18-alpine as base image.
- Re-introduced dbus and dbus-x11 packages to apk add to ensure D-Bus
  functionality is available when needed by the Puppeteer worker.
- Created a custom `start_puppeteer.sh` script to explicitly manage Xvfb
  startup and the node worker process, bypassing problematic `xvfb-run`
  behavior on Alpine Linux.
- Updated `Dockerfile.puppeteer` to use this new startup script.
- Modified `puppeteer_worker/worker.js` to include D-Bus daemon startup
  logic and adjusted Puppeteer launch arguments for better compatibility
  and to explicitly disable D-Bus features where appropriate.
- Added a new `puppeteer_debug_env/worker.js` for debugging purposes.
- Simplified `puppeteer_worker/debug_x11.sh` for clearer X11 debugging.
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to reflect new volume mounts.

These changes aim to provide a more stable and reliable environment for
Puppeteer operations within Docker.
